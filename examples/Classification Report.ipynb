This is because the more you think about it, the more it becomes your way of thinking. Thus it might cause the people who aborted to have a regret for the rest of their life or to have a regret of not ending someone's life before they are brought to life if they decided not to abort the child and they end up having disabilities for life.\n",

This is because if you are too young, you too will have a higher risk to have an abnormal baby for example, the young teens. Thus they, too, might want to abort their babies. Thus, in my opinion, he is talking about the late 30s because he assume that his readers are in their 30s or interested to know more about the pros and cons having babies when they are older.\n",

As stated in the passage, the economy world of the past targeted mainly the high class people however through music, middle class people are now able to buy cheap goods and services. Also because quantity and not quality was the priority of middle class when buying, the economy will work more efficiently and seller earn more at once.

      "The author mentioned that Singapore is steering towards a repetitive rote learning, and has three major examinations, each one as a student progresses through his or her school life, having one major examination before they graduate. However in Finland, their first national examination takes place at 18 years old, while in Singapore, a student would have already taken two major examinations and would be preparing for the third. This leads me to infer that continuously testing a student as they progress has helped in producing excellent results. The author also made reference to how Finland has failed to make progress with the Nokia phone. Although Nokia was once seated on a throne, regarded as an international champion, they have failed to continue to develop what they had and out themselves at a standstill. They did not progress further and thus, this led to their downward spiral. Other companies like Apple and Samsung have continued to develop and strive for better results and have since overtaken Nokia. Similarly with Finland's educational system, they were once 2nd in reading, 6th in Mathematics and 3rd in Science. However, while other countries like Singapore continue to progress, Finland has not. This has since led to Finland dropping through the rank from 2nd to 5th in reading, 6th to 12th in Mathematics and 3rd to 5th in Science. Therefore, I disagree with the author and feel that we should not emulate Finland's education system.\n",

In the poster, the stressful Singaporean lifestyle is emphasised in how they have to compete vigorously with foreign talent, which makes up a significantly high percentage of Singapore, not only one, but three important landmark exams dictating their future and how mother's are only given 4 months of maternity leave, which is clearly too short for the entire pregnancy period, recovery and time to look after and shape the child's earliest education, which is highly important. In contrast, Finland's education system seems much more relaxed, has much more parental support and focuses on a more holistic education (e.g strong recognition for vocational skills and professions) rather than solely academic.\n",

I think this is a problematic point of view as the scores are not the only factor in deciding the effectiveness of a education system. As many have stressed, the importance of school is also to learn practical skills whether it is in the form of 'fluid' skills that can be transferred or 'crystal' skills that are job specific. In this aspect, the Finish system can be seen as superior   with 50% of youths applying for vocational programs . This also shows initiative in learning which is also another aspect education hopes to instill in each and every person.\r\n",

Is writer's block real or is it all in your head?\" and later on brings up 'Executive Dysfunction\" which is \" the inability to put a stop on present behavior so as to not put off what you need to do in the future\". It may be possible that writer's doubt that they have writer's block is because of their inability to stop their present behavior as an excuse to continue procrastinating and doing other activities.\n",

This is because people can simply say that they have writer's block as an excuse to not write, as writer's block is not easy to be identified from the outside as the text show. So it is not just an article to assure writers, but also a possible article for exploitation.\n",
